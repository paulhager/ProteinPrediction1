presentation tips

- bootstrapping: draw 30000 instead of 1000 -- done
- add training score to overfitting plot
- outlay --> outline -- done
- no need to talk about snap files
- include slide with dataset numbers, imbalance etc (BioLip reference)
- also for testset 
- slide 5: switch cuttoff comparisons (?), put cutoffs on slide (slide we used before)
- scores for previous features
- show less parameter optimization

- show coverage, precision, ...
- convert scores to percent (?)
