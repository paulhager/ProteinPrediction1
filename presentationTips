presentation tips

x bootstrapping: draw 30000 instead of 1000
- add training score to overfitting plot
x outlay --> outline
x no need to talk about snap files
x include slide with dataset numbers, imbalance etc (BioLip reference)
- also for testset 
x slide 5: switch cuttoff comparisons (not necessary), put cutoffs on slide (slide we used before)
x scores for previous features
x show less parameter optimization

- show coverage (?), precision, ...
x convert scores to percent (?)

- ToDo
x done
