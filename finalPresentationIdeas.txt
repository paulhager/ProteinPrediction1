Slides:
Thomas: Architecture overview
Thomas: feature vector makeup
Thomas: First attempt using blosum cutoffs
Thomas: second attempt with raw scores
Thomas: third attempt with blosum normalization
Thomas: confusion matrix
Thomas: coverage and F1 score
Thomas: include comparison to random
Thomas: compare validation to trained data -> over/underfit?

Plot ideas:
Paul - mcc vs epochs - epochs should be high enough to observe overfitting
Paul - hyperparameter optimization
