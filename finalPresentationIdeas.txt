Slides:
Architecture overview
feature vector makeup
First attempt using blosum cutoffs
second attempt with raw scores
third attempt with blosum normalization
confusion matrix
coverage and F1 score
include comparison to random
compare validation to trained data -> over/underfit?

Plot ideas:
Paul - mcc vs epochs - epochs should be high enough to observe overfitting
Paul - hyperparameter optimization
