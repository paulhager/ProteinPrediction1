Slides:
Architecture overview
feature vector makeup
First attempt using blosum cutoffs
second attempt with raw scores
third attempt with blosum normalization
Thomas E: confusion matrix
Thomas H: coverage and F1 score
Thomas E: include comparison to random
Thomas H: compare validation to trained data -> over/underfit?

Plot ideas:
Paul - mcc vs epochs - epochs should be high enough to observe overfitting
Paul - hyperparameter optimization
