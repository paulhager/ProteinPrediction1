Slides:
Architecture overview
feature vector makeup
blosum normalization
confusion matrix
coverage and F1 score
include comparison to random
compare validation to trained data -> over/underfit?

Plot ideas:
mcc vs epochs - epochs should be high enough to observe overfitting
hyperparameter optimization
